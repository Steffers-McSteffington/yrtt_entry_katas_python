# In this Kata, you will be given an array of numbers in which two numbers occur once and the rest occur only twice. 
# Your task will be to return the sum of the numbers that occur only once.
# For example, singles([4,5,7,5,4,8]) = 15 because only the numbers 7 and 8 occur once, and their sum is 15.
# More examples in the test cases below.

# Good luck!

# I would change the function name from 'repeats' to 'singles' - 'repeats' is misleading (and not in keeping with tests in other languages)

def repeats(arr):

    # search the array for numbers that appear once
    # if number appears more than once throw entries away
    # if number appears only once add to list
    # add (two) remaining numbers together
    # display total

    return
